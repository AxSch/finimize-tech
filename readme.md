# Finimize dev challenge

## Python & Django setup

* Install `python3` via brew
* Clone the repo
* cd into repo
* Install `virtualenv` using `pip3` (think yarn)

```sh
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

* Create a virtualenv for the project

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```
If you're having trouble completing this step, try upgrading virtualenv first `pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv`

* Activate the virtualenv

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies in the new virtualenv

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the server

```
pip3 manage.py runserver
```
* Server should be running at http://localhost:8000 ðŸš€

## The challenge

### Part 1

1.
Create an API POST endpoint that takes 2 input values:

* `savings_amount`
* `interest_rate`

The API should calculate the value achieved after 12 months of saving when interested is payed monthly.
Bonus points: Use TDD

2.
Create a react app that has a form with 2 input fields:

* `savingsAmount`
* `interestRate`

upon submit, then form should call the API and display the result.

3.
Extend the API to take another input field:

* `interest_payout_frequency`

which concerns how often interest will be payed. Either â€˜monthly', â€˜quarterly' or â€˜annuallyâ€™. Remember to add proper input validation

4.
On the front-end, extend the form to take the above value as input, and update the API client.

### Part 2

5.
Let the API endpoint also recieve the following input:
`salary`
Add this value to the calc

6.
Extend the front-end to take the `salary` field.

7.
Let the API calculate what the total amount becomes after 50 years
